What conclusion should be drawn, with $\\alpha = 0.05$?\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n**Please attempt this problem using R.** Take a look at the information for the `t.test` function. You will need to set `x`, `y`, `alternative`, and `var.equal=T`. You can use the below groups coded in R.\n:::\n\n```{r}\ngrp1 = c(69.25, 72.80, 68.73, 72.01, 70.36, 71.49, 72.73)\ngrp2 = c(67.54, 68.51, 71.84, 70.59, 71.52, 71.50)\n```\n\n### Question 4\n\nThe choice of an alternative hypothesis ($H_A$ or $H_1$) should depend primarily on (choose all that apply). Explain your reasoning.\n\na.  the data obtained from the study.\n\nb.  what the investigator is interested in determining.\n\nc.  the critical region.\n\nd.  the significance level.\n\ne.  the power of the test.\n\n### Question 5\n\n[Visit this site on dplyr.](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/)\n\nFor one of the functions that we have not discussed in class, please use it on the `dds.discr` dataset. Please write in words what you would like to perform, then write the code.\n\nNote: the `dds.discr` dataset is an `.Rda` file. Instead of using `read_csv()` or `read_excel()`, you can use `load()`.\n\n### Question 6\n\nThe accompanying data `CH05Q01` gives the dry weights (Y) of 11 chick embryos ranging in age from 6 to 16 days (X ). Also given in the data are the values of the common logarithms of the weights (Z).\n\n-   Load the dataset using the `readxl` package.\n    -   This `readxl` package was installed as a part of the tidyverse, however it does not get loaded when you load the tidyverse package and thus you need to do that separately.\n    -   Use the command `read_excel()`, as shown below\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(readxl)\n# you might need to update the location of the data file\n# you can choose whatever name you like for the tibble when loading it into R's workspace \nch05q01 <- read_excel(\"./data/CH05Q01.xls\")\n```\n\n#### Part a\n\nCreate two scatterplots in R using ggplot:\n\n1.  Between age (X) and dry weight (Y)\n\n2.  Between age (X) and log10 dry weight (Z)\n\nObserve the following two scatter diagrams. Describe the relationships between age (X) and dry weight (Y) and between age and log10 dry weight (Z).\n\n#### Part b\n\nState the population simple linear regression models for these two regressions: Y regressed on X and Z regressed on X.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\nThis is asking for the regression models BEFORE you find the values of the coefficients.\n:::\n\n#### Part c\n\nDetermine the least-squares estimates of each of the regression lines in part (b).\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\nNow get the regression coefficients using R and plug them into the regression models from (b). You can get the coefficients from the R output!\n:::\n\n#### Part d\n\nUsing `ggplot`, create the respective best-fit lines on your plots. Which of the two regression lines has the better fit? Based on your answers to parts (a)–(c), is it more appropriate to run a linear regression of Y on X or of Z on X? Explain.\n\n#### Part e (to be covered on Monday 1/22)\n\nFor the regression that you chose as being more appropriate in part (d), find 95% confidence intervals for the true slope and intercept. Interpret each interval ~~with regard to the null hypothesis that the true value is 0~~.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\nYou can get the CI's from the R output\n:::\n\n#### Part f\n\nFor the regression that you chose as being more appropriate in part (d), add 95% confidence ~~and prediction~~ bands. Using your sketch, find and interpret an approximate 95% confidence interval for the mean response of an 8-day-old chick.\n\n\n## Question 7\n\nGo to the [R Documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/lm) of the `lm()` function. Please answer the following questions about the function arguments and output.\n\n### Part a\n\nIf you wanted to perform weighted least squares in R, what argument would you need to change?\n\n### Part b\n\nWhat is the default method in `lm()`? Can it be used to solve OLS? (Hint: check out the Wiki page for the method)\n\n### Part c\n\nIn linear regression, a singular fit means that the estimated standard deviation of your residuals is very close to zero. In the `lm()` function, will you get an error if you have a singular fit?\n\n## Question 8\n\n**Quick True/False question:** Is ordinary least squares the only way to find the best fit line for linear regression?\n\nExplain your reasoning.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rstatix)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(here)\n```\n\n## Directions\n\n-   [Download the `.qmd` file here.](https://github.com/nwakim/BSTA_512_W25/blob/main/homework/HW_01.qmd)\n\n-   You will need to download the datasets.
