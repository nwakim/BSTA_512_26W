Data were collected using questionnaires during a baseline interview and also medical chart review. More information about this study can be found in the article [Fatalism, optimism, spirituality, depressive symptoms and stroke outcome: a population based analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21940963/).\n\nThe dataset that you will work with is called `completedata.sas7bdat`. The two variables we are interested in are:\n\n-   Covariate 1: `Fatalism` (larger values indicate that the individual feels less control of their life)\n\n    -   Potential scores range from 8 to 40\n\n-   Covariate 2: `Optimism` (larger values indicate that the individual feels higher levels of optimism)\n\n    -   Potential scores range from 6 to 24\n\n-   Covariate 3: `Spirituality` (larger values indicate that the individual has more belief in a higher power)\n\n    -   Potential scores range from 2 to 8\n\n-   Outcome: `Depression` (larger values imply increased depression)\n\n    -   Potential scores range from 0 to 27\n\nFor our homework purposes we will assume each variable is continuous.\n\n```{r}\ndep_df = read_sas(here(\"./data/completedata.sas7bdat\"))\n```\n\n#### Part a\n\nFit the regression model with all the covariates (Fatalism, Optimism, Spirituality), display the regression table, and write out the fitted regression line.\n\n#### Part b\n\nDoes at least one of the covariates contribute significantly to the prediction of Depression? (Note: this is an overall test. Please follow the hypothesis test steps. To complete step 4-6, simply output your ANOVA table.)\n\n\n#### Part c\n\nDoes the addition of Spirituality add significantly to the prediction of Depression achieved by Fatalism and Optimism?\n\n\n#### Part d\n\nDoes the addition of Spirituality and Optimism add significantly to the prediction of Depression achieved by Fatalism?\n\n\n### Question 2 {#sec-L11-L12-Interactions-01}\n\nA team of nutrition experts investigated the influence of protein content in diet on the relationship between age (explanatory variable) and height (outcome, in centimeters) for children. Using the dataset, `CH12Q03.xls`, answer the following questions.\n\nThis question was adapted from [this textbook](https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/7546272).\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nprotein <- read_excel(\"./data/CH12Q03.xls\") # change this to the appropriate file location\n```\n\n#### Part a\n\nUsing R, make a variable that is a factor for Diet. Make sure to check what values the original variable for Diet can take. How many indicator functions do you need to represent the categorical variable Diet (protein-rich vs. protein-poor)?\n\n\n#### Part b\n\nAt a level of significance $\\alpha = 0.10$, test whether protein diet modifies the effect of age on height. Justify your answer (e.g., perform a hypothesis test for the interaction between diet and age).\n\n*Note: recall that we model an effect modifier with an interaction.*\n\n#### Part c\n\nIs it possible that diet is a confounder? Note: this will depend on your results from Part b. \n\n#### Part d\n\nWrite the fitted regression equation for our model in Part b. Write the respective regression lines for each specific diet group: protein rich and protein poor. Interpret the slope of each regression line (include the 95% CI here).\n\n### Question 3 {#sec-L11-L12-Interactions-02}\n\nAn experiment was conducted regarding a quantitative analysis of factors found in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in a sample of human blood serum. Three variables thought to be predictive of, or associated with, HDL measurement (Y) were the total cholesterol (X1) and total triglyceride (X2) concentrations in the sample, plus the presence or absence of a certain sticky component of the serum called sinking pre-beta or SPB (X3), coded as 0 if absent and 1 if present. Using the dataset, `CH09Q05.xls`, answer the following questions.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\nHDL_factors <- read_excel(here(\"./data/CH09Q05.xls\")) # change this to the appropriate file location\n```\n\n#### Part a {#sec-Q3-Part-a}\n\nUse $\\alpha= 0.05$, test whether if there is a crude association between HDL measurement and total cholesterol. Note: testing for a crude association means we fit a simple linear regression model and see if the association is significant. \n\n#### Part b\n\nSometimes simple linear regression leads us to believe that there is no association between two variables, but missing interaction might be obscuring the association. Use $\\alpha= 0.1$ to test whether total triglyceride is an effect modifier of the association between HDL and total cholesterol. Make sure to include a concluding statement.\n\nNote: Since the data frame has the variables named as $Y$, $X1$, and $X2$, you may use those in the regression equations, but when you are making a conclusion, please use the specific names of the variables to identify each. For example, $Y$ is actually HDL. \n\n#### Part c\n\nTest whether total triglyceride is a confounder by comparing the model in Part a to a model that includes total triglyceride. Make sure to include a concluding statement and interpret your coefficients. \n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{=html}\n<style>div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}</style>\n```\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, fig.align = \"center\")\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rstatix)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(ggfortify)  # autoplot(model)\nlibrary(gtsummary)\nlibrary(describedata) # gladder()\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(here)\n```\n\n\n## Directions\n\n-   [Download the `.qmd` file here.](https://github.com/nwakim/BSTA_512_W25/blob/main/homework/HW_04.qmd)\n\n-   You will need to download the datasets.
