The response of each rat was measured as the concentration of a clotting agent needed to clot a sample of its blood in 3 minutes. The results of the experiment on 12 rats are given in the following table; values are expressed in common logarithms for both dose and response.\n\n```{r}\nclot = read_excel(here(\"./data/CH05Q09.xls\"))\nclot %>% gt() %>%\n  cols_label(RAT = md(\"**Rat**\"),\n             LOGCONC = md(\"**Log10 Concentration (Y)**\"),\n             LOGDOSE = md(\"**Log10 Dose (X)**\"))\n```\n\nUse the log-transformed values as given in the dataset.\n\nUse the following scatterplot to build your answers off of:\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-height: 5\n#| fig-width: 6.5\n#| fig-align: center\n#| echo: false\n\nggplot(clot, aes(x = LOGDOSE,\n                 y = LOGCONC)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  labs(x = \"Log10 dose (X)\", \n       y = \"Log10 concentration (Y)\",\n       title = \"Concentration of clotting agent needed vs. dosage levels of liver\") +\n    theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n        axis.text = element_text(size = 12), \n        title = element_text(size = 12))\n```\n\n#### Part a\n\nFit a linear regression model to the data and add the regression line to the plot.\n\n#### Part b\n\nUse R to create the ANOVA table for the regression described in the exercise.\n\n#### Part c\n\nUsing the F-test, determine whether there is an association between the log10 concentration and log10 dose.\n\n::: callout-note\nMake sure to include all needed steps for an F-test. Calculating the F test statistic (step 5) is not needed if you use the ANOVA table. Make sure your conclusion connects back the research context.\n:::\n\n#### Part d\n\nRewrite your hypothesis test in Part c to show the null and alternative models that we are testing. Did we reject the smaller (reduced) model?\n\n::: callout-note\nYou do not need to go through the hypothesis test process again. A quick statement on rejecting or not is okay.\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\nIf you prefer to write out the models by hand, remember that you can take a picture of your work and insert it into this document. HW0 can be a good reference for how we've done this before.\n:::\n\n### Question 2\n\nWe will continue to work with the study and dataset from Question 2 above.\n\n#### Part a\n\nFind the correlation coefficient between the two variables. Is the value consistent with your description of the relationship in Question 2? Why or why not?\n\n#### Part b\n\nCalculate the coefficient of determination using linear regression summary output. Can we also calculate the coefficient of determination from the ANOVA in Question 2?\n\n#### Part c\n\nGive an interpretation of the coefficient of determination in the context of the study.\n\n\n### Question 3\n\nA high respiratory rate is a potential diagnostic indicator of respiratory infection in children. To judge whether a respiratory rate is “high” however, a physician must have a clear picture of the distribution of normal rates. To this end, Italian researchers measured the respiratory rates (in breaths/minute) of 618 children between the ages of 15 days and 3 years (measured in months).\n\nThe data and problem framing came from the `Sleuth3` package. Please make sure to run the following code to load the data. You can directly access the dataset `ex0824` from the package. I have included a new assignment of the data to `q1_data` if you would like to use that.\n\n```{r}\n#| message: false\n\nif(!require(Sleuth3)) { install.packages(\"Sleuth3\"); library(Sleuth3) }\nq1_data = ex0824 \n```\n\n#### Part a\n\nCreate a scatterplot of the dependent and independent variables with both the best-fit line and a smoothed curve through the points. Describe the relationship between the dependent and independent variables, and also comment on whether you think it is reasonable to use a linear regression to model the relationship.\n\n#### Part b\n\nWrite out the population regression model for the simple linear regression model. Please leave the variables untransformed for now.\n\n#### Part c\n\nFit the regression model, display the regression table, and write out the fitted regression line.\n\n#### Part d\n\nAssess the normality of the model's fitted residuals by creating a histogram, density plot, and boxplot of the residuals to visually inspect the distribution of the residuals, and describe any deviations from normality.\n\n\n#### Part e\n\nAssess the normality of the model's fitted residuals by creating QQ plot of the residuals.\n\nBonus work, but not required: Compare the QQ plot to 4 such plots simulated from normal data, and discuss why or why not the residuals could have come from a normal distribution.\n\n#### Part f\n\nTest the normality of the model's fitted residuals and comment on whether the test's conclusion is consistent with your visual inspection or not. Make sure to include the hypotheses, needed R code, and a conclusion to the test based on the p-value ([as shown in these slides](https://nwakim.github.io/W2024_BSTA_512/slides/06_SLR_Diagnostics.html#/n-shapiro-wilk-test-of-normality)).\n\n#### Part g\n\nCreate a residual plot using ggplot and the residuals. Discuss what this means in the context of our model assumptions.\n\n#### Part h\n\nDetermine whether there are any observations with high leverage. Please use the cutoff, $h_i > 6/n$. If there are observations with high leverage, print the observations and state how many high leverage points there are.\n\n#### Part i\n\nPrint the 10 observations with highest Cook's distance. If there are observations with high Cook's distance ($d_i >1$), state how many observations have high Cook's distance.\n\n#### Part j\n\nCreate a histogram for rate. Describe its distribution shapes.\n\n#### Part k\n\nUsing the above histogram, and Tukey's ladder of transformations, discuss the range of transformations that will be appropriate for **Rate**. Explain your reasoning.\n\nThen use `gladder()` to decide on two possible transformations. Explain your reasoning.\n\nNote: questions below will ask about model fit with the transformations. For now, just explain why you chose the two that you did.\n\n#### Part l\n\nAdd the two rate transformations you chose above to the dataset. You do not need to print any output, just make sure the code is visible.\n\n#### Part m\n\nCreate scatterplots using two transformed rates and age. Discuss if either transformation potentially improves the model fit. Explain why or why not. Note: including lines will help!\n\n#### Part n\n\nUsing one of the transoformed outcomes, fit the regression model, display the regression table, and write out the fitted regression line.\n\n#### Part o\n\nAssess the normality of the model’s fitted residuals by creating QQ plot of the residuals. Does the transformation improve the QQ plot?\n\n#### Part p\n\nCreate a residual plot using ggplot and the residuals. Discuss what this means in the context of our model assumptions. Does the transformation improve our model assumptions?\n\n#### Part q\n\nBetween the model with the untransformed outcome and the transformed outcome, which would you recommend using for analysis? (Hint: there are pros and cons to both models)\n\n### Question 4\n\nThis question uses the same dataset as HW 2, question 1.\n\nThis question is based on data collected as part of an observational study of patients who suffered from stroke.\n\nDataset: The main goal was to study various psychological factors: optimism, fatalism, depression, spirituality, and their relationship with stroke severity and other health outcomes among the study participants. Data were collected using questionnaires during a baseline interview and also medical chart review. More information about this study can be found in the article [Fatalism, optimism, spirituality, depressive symptoms and stroke outcome: a population based analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21940963/).\n\nThe dataset that you will work with is called `completedata.sas7bdat`. The two variables we are interested in are:\n\n-   Covariate 1: `Fatalism` (larger values indicate that the individual feels less control of their life)\n\n    -   Potential scores range from 8 to 40\n\n-   Covariate 2: `Optimism` (larger values indicate that the individual feels higher levels of optimism)\n\n    -   Potential scores range from 6 to 24\n\n-   Covariate 3: `Spirituality` (larger values indicate that the individual has more belief in a higher power)\n\n    -   Potential scores range from 2 to 8\n\n-   Outcome: `Depression` (larger values imply increased depression)\n\n    -   Potential scores range from 0 to 27\n\nFor our homework purposes we will assume each variable is continuous.\n\n```{r}\ndep_df = read_sas(here(\"./data/completedata.sas7bdat\"))\n```\n\n#### Part a\n\nFit the regression model with all the covariates (Fatalism, Optimism, Spirituality), display the regression table, and write out the fitted regression line.\n\n#### Part b\n\nInterpret each coefficient ($\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$, $\\beta_3$).\n\nDoes the intercept make sense for the range of values that each covariate can take? Explain.\n\n\n#### Part c\n\nRecall in Homework 2, we ran a simple linear regression model for Depression vs. Fatalism with the following interpretation for the coefficient: For every 1 point higher fatalism score, there is an expected difference of 0.25 points higher depression score (95%CI: 0.17, 0.32).\n\nDoes the addition of Optimism and Spirituality change our coefficient estimate for Fatalism? (No need for an official hypothesis test here. I just want us to note some differences.)\n\n\n#### Part d\n\nFrom the fitted regression model, calculate the regression line when Optimism score is 10 and Spirituality score is 6.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rstatix)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(ggfortify)  # autoplot(model)\nlibrary(gtsummary)\nlibrary(describedata) # gladder()\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(here)\n```\n\n::: callout-caution\nThis homework is ready! 2/6/25\n:::\n\n## Directions\n\n-   [Download the `.qmd` file here.](https://github.com/nwakim/BSTA_512_W25/blob/main/homework/HW_03.qmd)\n\n-   You will need to download the datasets.
