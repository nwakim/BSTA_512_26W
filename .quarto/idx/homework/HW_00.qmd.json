I want to make sure we are all familiar with the process of downloading a `.qmd`** file, editing it, and resubmitting an `.html` and `.qmd` file.\n\nHere are the instructions for downloading and submitting your homework:\n\n1.  Go to [this github site](https://github.com/nwakim/BSTA_512_W25/blob/main/homework/HW_00.qmd) to download the homework's `.qmd` file.\n\n2.  When you reach the site, it should look like this (from my 2023 class):![](hw_images/HW0_github.png)\n\n3.  Click the \"Download raw file\" icon (![](hw_images/download_icon.png){width=\"25\"}) to download the `.qmd` file. This will likely download the file into your \"Downloads\" folder. It is up to you to move the file into the appropriate folder.\n\n4.  Please rename you homework as `Lastname_Firstinitial_HW0.qmd` . This will help organize the homeworks when the TAs grade them.\n\n5.  Please also update the following line under `subtitle: \"BSTA 512/612\"`: `author: First-name Last-name` with your first and last name so it is attached to the viewable document.\n\n6.  Edit the document with your explanations and code. If you are writing out an answer or calculating by hand, you can take a picture of your work and embed it within the `.qmd` file. The pictures will be viewable on the `.html` file.\n\n7.  Please upload your homework to this Sakai assignment. **Upload both your `.qmd` code file and the rendered `.html` file**.\n\nThese instructions will not appear on every homework. You may come back to this page for reference.\n\n### Purpose\n\nThis homework is meant to introduce yourself to me. I'd like you to share some information over Sakai.\n\n### Grading\n\nGrading will be done as a check/no check for turning in your work. If you are stressed about time, please turn in whatever you have completed.\n\n## Questions\n\n### Question 1\n\nPlease upload a picture of yourself to Sakai. Make sure your face is visible in this picture. It will help me and the TAs identify you. \n\nPlease follow the below steps to add a picture of yourself in Sakai:\n\n1.  Click on the top right circle on your Sakai page. If you do not have a picture already, your initials will be showing.\n2.  Click \"Profile.\"\n3.  Once in your profile, hover over the square then click \"Change picture.\"\n4.  Upload a picture file of yourself.\n\n*Please include the picture you used below. This will make sure we are all able to insert a picture within Quarto. It will also make sure I can see the photo within the `.html` file.*\n\n### Question 2\n\nProvide a pronunciation of your name: Please follow the below steps to add an audio and written pronunciation of your name in Sakai:\n\n1.  Click on the top right circle on your Sakai page. If you do not have a picture already, your initials will be showing.\n2.  Click \"Profile.\"\n3. Hover over the section \"Name Pronunciation and Pronouns.\" Click the edit button that should appear in the top right corner of the section.\n4. Add a recording of your name pronunciation.\n5. OPTIONAL You may also edit the phonetic pronunciation of your name. I realize that doing this is may require a lot of time researching phonetics.\n6. OPTIONAL If you are comfortable sharing your pronouns, please change these as well.\n\n\n### Question 3\n\nPlease complete the [following whenisgood poll](https://whenisgood.net/amhssx9) so that we can schedule office hours. Please use a unique identifier (does not have to be your name), so that I can make sure each student can attend at least one office hour.\n\n### Question 4\n\nCompletion of this question is only necessary if you have accommodations. If you have any learning accommodations, please email me about your needs. I should receive a direct email from the Office of Student Access, but it is important that we discuss how accommodations will translate to our class.\n\n### Question 5\n\nGo to the [OneDrive folder](https://ohsuitg-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/wakim_ohsu_edu/EpUBcHEh3gxFpNbGHtayubkB_CZdoO2_u-TyTn2UW36dcQ) and request access.\n\n### Question 6\n\nVote on your preferred attendance policy [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=V3lz4rj6fk2U9pvWr59xWFMopmPUjRtDiHLswhgacNhUMVhOTTNJVklJNkREWUZVRlJOVjA0RDNSNC4u)!\n\n### Question 7\n\nIf you are submitting a late homework or informing me about an extension, who should be included in the email? \n\n(See Syllabus for answer)\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n::: callout-caution\nHomework is ready! 1/6/25\n:::\n\n## Directions\n\n**This homework must be turned into Sakai.
