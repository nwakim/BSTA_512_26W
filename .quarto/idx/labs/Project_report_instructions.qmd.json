(3/15/2024)**\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n::: callout-important\n## Project template\n\nYou *may* use [this project template](https://github.com/nwakim/W2024_BSTA_512/blob/main/labs/Project_template.qmd) to get started on the report. It is your responsibility to meet the formatting guidelines below!!\n\nDO NOT USE SITE PAGE (\"Project Report Instructions\", current page) as your template!!\n:::\n\n### Purpose\n\nProject reports serve as a great way to communicate the knowledge learned in a statistics class and connect it to context within research. It is important that we can take a step back from the numbers and analysis to see what questions linear regression can help us answer.\n\n### Formatting guide\n\n-   The report will be written in Quarto. Turn in both the `qmd` and `html` files\n    -   **No code** should appear in the `html` document\n        -   This means all R code chunks should have `#| echo: false`\n        -   This also means warnings and messages should be turned off\n-   The report should be 10 - 14 paragraphs long\n-   Tables and figures should NOT have variable names as they appear in the data frame\n    -   Variable names should be understood by a reader\n    -   Variable names should be written in full words\n    -   Include a title or caption for all figures\n    -   Figure and tables appear on same page or close to same page where they are first referenced\n    -   Tables and figures are an appropriate size in the html - Nicky is able to read all words in figures and tables\n-   Writing, spelling, and grammar should be admissable\n    -   This means I can generally follow your thought/what you are trying to communicate\n    -   Some spelling and grammar mistakes are allowed\n        -   I will not take off points if there are a few sprinkled in\n        -   If *every or close to every* sentence has mistakes, then I will take off\n-   Sectioning of the report\n    -   Main sections that were required: Introduction, Statistical Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, and References\n    -   Other sections that might help group specific methods or results\n-   Title information at the top of the `html`\n    -   This includes the title itself, your name, and the date\n\n::: callout-note\n#### The project report is a separate file from the labs\n\nYou can save tables and figures from labs or separate files, then load them in the report\n\n-   Save R objects in analyses file:\n    -   Suppose you named the Table 1 as `table1`\n    -   `save(table1, file = \"table1.Rdata\")`\n-   Load R objects in report file: `load(file = \"table1.Rdata\")`\n:::\n\n### Examples of reports\n\nThe following are examples of reports from BSTA 513 with the feedback that I gave them.\n\nPlease note that 513 uses a different type of outcome than our class. These examples are meant to help guide you with the formatting and some appropriate content.\n\nAlso note that these were converted to PDFs so I could write in feedback. Some of the tables and figure sizes were distorted. They need to be legible in the `html`.\n\n-   [Report 1 with my feedback](https://ohsuitg-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/personal/wakim_ohsu_edu/Documents/Teaching/Classes/W2024_BSTA_512_612/Student_files/Project_examples/Group_09_Report.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=54lAbD)\n\n-   [Report 2 with my feedback](https://ohsuitg-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/personal/wakim_ohsu_edu/Documents/Teaching/Classes/W2024_BSTA_512_612/Student_files/Project_examples/Group_07_Report.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=uWHgnB)\n\nThe above reports have code showing in their `html`. Remember that I am asking you to **hide** all code, warnings, and messages.\n\n### Grading\n\nThe project report is out of 36 points. Note that the Statistical Methods and Results sections are graded on an 8-point scale, while all other components are graded on a 4-point scale.\n\n#### Rubric\n\n|                           | 4 points                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 3 points                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 2 points                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 1 point                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 0 points                                                                                                                                                              |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Formatting                | Lab submitted on Sakai (or by email if late) with `.html` file.

I actually pair it with Zotero and it works beautifully! (But I would not embark on this if you haven't used Zotero before)\n\n## Sections\n\n### Title\n\n-   **Purpose:** Create an identifiable name for your research project that includes the main research question's variables and gives some context to the analysis or results\n\n### Introduction\n\n-   **Length: 1-2 paragraphs**\n-   **Purpose:** Introduce the research question and why it is important to study\n-   This section is non-technical.\n    -   By reading just the introduction and conclusion, someone without a technical background should have an idea of what they study was about, why it is important, and what the main results are\n-   You may start with the introduction written in Lab 1, but you should edit it and make sure it flows into your report well!\n-   Should contain some references\n\n### Statistical Methods\n\n-   **Length: 3-5 paragraphs**\n-   **Purpose:** Describe the analyses that were conducted and methods used to select variables and check diagnostics\n-   **Important to keep in mind:** methods typically describe your approach and process, not the results of that process\n    -   For example: I might say \"We investigated the linearity of each continuous covariate visually. If continuous variables were not linear, then we divided the variable into categories using existing guidelines from \\<insert reference here\\> or creating quartiles.\"\n        -   In the methods section, I would NOT say: \"We investigated the linearity of each continuous covariate visually.

(3/15/2024)**\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Directions\n\n::: callout-important\n## Project template\n\nYou *may* use [this project template](https://github.com/nwakim/W2024_BSTA_512/blob/main/labs/Project_template.qmd) to get started on the report. It is your responsibility to meet the formatting guidelines below!!\n\nDO NOT USE SITE PAGE (\"Project Report Instructions\", current page) as your template!!\n:::\n\n### Purpose\n\nProject reports serve as a great way to communicate the knowledge learned in a statistics class and connect it to context within research. It is important that we can take a step back from the numbers and analysis to see what questions linear regression can help us answer.\n\n### Formatting guide\n\n-   The report will be written in Quarto. Turn in both the `qmd` and `html` files\n    -   **No code** should appear in the `html` document\n        -   This means all R code chunks should have `#| echo: false`\n        -   This also means warnings and messages should be turned off\n-   The report should be 10 - 14 paragraphs long\n-   Tables and figures should NOT have variable names as they appear in the data frame\n    -   Variable names should be understood by a reader\n    -   Variable names should be written in full words\n    -   Include a title or caption for all figures\n    -   Figure and tables appear on same page or close to same page where they are first referenced\n    -   Tables and figures are an appropriate size in the html - Nicky is able to read all words in figures and tables\n-   Writing, spelling, and grammar should be admissable\n    -   This means I can generally follow your thought/what you are trying to communicate\n    -   Some spelling and grammar mistakes are allowed\n        -   I will not take off points if there are a few sprinkled in\n        -   If *every or close to every* sentence has mistakes, then I will take off\n-   Sectioning of the report\n    -   Main sections that were required: Introduction, Statistical Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, and References\n    -   Other sections that might help group specific methods or results\n-   Title information at the top of the `html`\n    -   This includes the title itself, your name, and the date\n\n::: callout-note\n#### The project report is a separate file from the labs\n\nYou can save tables and figures from labs or separate files, then load them in the report\n\n-   Save R objects in analyses file:\n    -   Suppose you named the Table 1 as `table1`\n    -   `save(table1, file = \"table1.Rdata\")`\n-   Load R objects in report file: `load(file = \"table1.Rdata\")`\n:::\n\n### Examples of reports\n\nThe following are examples of reports from BSTA 513 with the feedback that I gave them.\n\nPlease note that 513 uses a different type of outcome than our class. These examples are meant to help guide you with the formatting and some appropriate content.\n\nAlso note that these were converted to PDFs so I could write in feedback. Some of the tables and figure sizes were distorted. They need to be legible in the `html`.\n\n-   [Report 1 with my feedback](https://ohsuitg-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/personal/wakim_ohsu_edu/Documents/Teaching/Classes/W2024_BSTA_512_612/Student_files/Project_examples/Group_09_Report.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=54lAbD)\n\n-   [Report 2 with my feedback](https://ohsuitg-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/personal/wakim_ohsu_edu/Documents/Teaching/Classes/W2024_BSTA_512_612/Student_files/Project_examples/Group_07_Report.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=uWHgnB)\n\nThe above reports have code showing in their `html`. Remember that I am asking you to **hide** all code, warnings, and messages.\n\n### Grading\n\nThe project report is out of 36 points. Note that the Statistical Methods and Results sections are graded on an 8-point scale, while all other components are graded on a 4-point scale.\n\n#### Rubric\n\n|                           | 4 points                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 3 points                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 2 points                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 1 point                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 0 points                                                                                                                                                              |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Formatting                | Lab submitted on Sakai (or by email if late) with `.html` file.

I actually pair it with Zotero and it works beautifully! (But I would not embark on this if you haven't used Zotero before)\n\n## Sections\n\n### Title\n\n-   **Purpose:** Create an identifiable name for your research project that includes the main research question's variables and gives some context to the analysis or results\n\n### Introduction\n\n-   **Length: 1-2 paragraphs**\n-   **Purpose:** Introduce the research question and why it is important to study\n-   This section is non-technical.\n    -   By reading just the introduction and conclusion, someone without a technical background should have an idea of what they study was about, why it is important, and what the main results are\n-   You may start with the introduction written in Lab 1, but you should edit it and make sure it flows into your report well!\n-   Should contain some references\n\n### Statistical Methods\n\n-   **Length: 3-5 paragraphs**\n-   **Purpose:** Describe the analyses that were conducted and methods used to select variables and check diagnostics\n-   **Important to keep in mind:** methods typically describe your approach and process, not the results of that process\n    -   For example: I might say \"We investigated the linearity of each continuous covariate visually. If continuous variables were not linear, then we divided the variable into categories using existing guidelines from \\<insert reference here\\> or creating quartiles.\"\n        -   In the methods section, I would NOT say: \"We investigated the linearity of each continuous covariate visually. We found that age was not linearly related to IAT scores. Thus, we categorized age into the following groups: \\_\\_\\_, \\_\\_\\_\\_, \\_\\_\\_\\_, \\_\\_\\_\\_, and \\_\\_\\_\\_.\"\n            -   The last two sentences about age would be more appropriate in the Results section\n-   **Some important methods to discuss** (You may divide these into your sections, not necessarily with these names)\n    -   General approach to the dataset\n        -   3-5 sentences\n        -   Did you need to do any quality control?\n        -   Missing data: we performed complete case analysis\n            -   1 sentence\n            -   Can be included in the Exploratory data analysis section\n    -   Variables and variable creation\n        -   This includes a description of analyses for Table 1 and what statistics were used to summarize the variables\n            -   More on creation of Table 1, not discussing the results of Table 1\n        -   Includes (not required)\n            -   Indicators for gender identity or race\n            -   Creating BMI\n            -   Categorizing a continuous variable (even if performed in model selection)\n            -   Using scoring for an ordered categorical variable (that is not your explanatory variable)\n        -   1-2 sentences per variable\n    -   Model building: we performed purposeful selection\n        -   3-5 sentences\n        -   Includes\n            -   Describe purposeful selection: combining existing literature, clinical significance, and analysis\n            -   How did you build the model? Describe the process\n            -   Did you consider confounders and effect modifiers?\n    -   Model diagnostics\n        -   2-5 sentences\n        -   Includes\n            -   Process of investigating model diagnostics\n            -   By the time you build the model, LINE assumptions should be met\n            -   If assumptions were not met, what process did you use to fix it?\n\n### Results\n\n-   **Length: \\~3 paragraphs**\n-   **Purpose:** Relay the results from our sample's analysis typically focusing on the numbers and interpretations\n-   Some important results to discuss (also could be sections)\n    -   Sample data set statistics (Table 1)\n        -   3-5 sentences\n        -   Include a brief description of the sample’s characteristics\n        -   Table 1 should be referenced and appear here!\n    -   Final model\n        -   1-2 sentences\n        -   Describe final model (or models if comparing a few)\n            -   What variables were included in your final model?\n            -   What interactions with your explanatory variable did you include?\n    -   Interpret the model coefficients in the context of the research question\n        -   1-2 paragraphs\n        -   Interpreting the explanatory variable's relationship with IAT score is the most important thing to report!!\n            -   When doing this, make sure you account for ALL interactions: If your explanatory variable has multiple interactions and you are trying to interpret one, then what does that mean about the other variables involved in the other interactions? If this is confusing, please make an appointment with me!!\n    -   Results of model diagnostics if there is anything worth noting\n-   Tables & figures\n    -   The following are required tables or figures\n        -   Table 1 summarizing participant characteristics both **overall** and **stratified by your primary independent variable**\n        -   Table or figure with regression results\n            -   Can be a forest plot\n            -   If you have A LOT of coefficient estimates, the forest plot may not work well!\n    -   **1-3 figures that you think are helpful in understanding the results, for example**\n        -   DAG explaining connection between variables (if you did this)\n        -   Table or figure to compare model fit statistics (if you did this)\n        -   Table or figure for unadjusted relationship between outcome and explanatory variables\n\n### Discussion\n\n-   **Length: 2-3 paragraphs**\n-   **Purpose:** Discuss the results and give them context outside of the sample and its analysis\n-   Some important things to include\n    -   Include a paragraph on the limitations of the results\n        -   You don't need to hit all the limitations, but think about the big ones (generalizability? independence of samples? large sample size vs. clinical significance? the way we handled variables?)\n    -   After limitations, discuss the positive parts of the results\n        -   What can we do with these results? What impact can it have?\n    -   Any overarching trends that are worth noting? [@Giebel2024]\n-   Should contain some references\n\n### Conclusion\n\n-   **Length: 1 short paragraph (more like \\~3 sentences)**\n-   **Purpose:** Describe the main conclusions to a non-technical audience\n\n### References\n\n-   Include your references here!\n-   You introduction should have references, especially when discussing the social science behind the analysis\n-   You must reference the IAT data source!!\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","title-prefix":"","toc":true,"self-contained":true,"number-sections":true,"number-offset":-1,"output-file":"Project_report_instructions.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
