You can change the wording if you'd like, but please make sure it is still clear.

In homework 1, we discussed what `glm()` does with missing values automatically. \n\n::: callout-important\n#### Task\n\nFit a main effects model with 5 of your covariates. This will not necessarily be your final model, but we can construct interpretations and code that will be useful in your final model. \n:::\n\n### Present the odds ratio in a table\n\n::: callout-important\n#### Task\n\nUse the `tbl_regression()` function to make a table of the odds ratios from your fitted model.\n:::\n\n### Present the odds ratio in a forest plot\n\n::: callout-important\n#### Task\n\nUse the code from our lesson on Multiple Logistic Regression (Lesson 9) to make a forest plot of the odds ratio from your fitted model. Make sure your main variable looks presentable! The other ones do not need to look perfect since they may not be in your final model. \n:::\n\n### Interpret the odds ratio for your main covariate\n\n::: callout-important\n#### Task\n\nInterpret the estimated odds ratio(s) for the covariate from your research question.
