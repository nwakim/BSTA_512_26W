Transformations - in 'real life', would you try transforming X alone, Y alone, and X and Y together? Or was that just an example for today's lesson?\n\nYes, that is a good order of things! We will talk more about the reasoning for X first when we get to multiple linear regression. The main point is that transforming our covariates (X's) will not impact the linear relationship between other X's and the outcome (Y).

When there are obvious issues, especially with linearity, then we need to make a transformation. \n\nSome fields typically use transformations because of known properties of the data. For example, gene expression data are often log-transformed. In this case, there is heteroscedasticity inherent in the data that needs to be fixed (giving it homoscedasticity).\n\n### 5. Are outliers and high leverage points synonymous with one another? I get the general gist that they are values far away from X_bar, but what is the difference between the two?\n\nThey are NOT synonymous. Only high leverage points are observations far from $\\overline{X}$. Outliers are observations that do not follow the general trend of the other observations. This means an outlier can be right at $\\overline{X}$, but have a Y-value falls very far from the $\\widehat{Y}$ line. \n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Muddy Points from Winter 2025\n\n### 1. using `gladder()`\n\n`gladder` will show you what the transformation of a single variable looks like.
