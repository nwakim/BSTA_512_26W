Talk by Dr. Mariana Chilton: The Painful Truth About Hunger in America. Wednesday, January 15th 3:00 pm – 5:00 pm in Vanport 515.\nJoin the SPH as they host the esteemed Dr. Mariana Chilton for an enlightening talk on \"The Painful Truth About Hunger in America.\" With over 25 years of dedicated research, programming, and advocacy in the field, Dr. Chilton is a leading expert in addressing the systemic roots of hunger and poverty in the United States. Her book challenges conventional wisdom about hunger, highlighting that the issue extends beyond mere food scarcity to deeper, systemic socio-political issues. Drawing on interviews and extensive research, Dr. Chilton argues that to truly eradicate hunger, a holistic approach involving personal, political, and spiritual transformation is necessary.\nThis engaging talk will not only shed light on the hidden truths of food insecurity but also inspire actionable change.
