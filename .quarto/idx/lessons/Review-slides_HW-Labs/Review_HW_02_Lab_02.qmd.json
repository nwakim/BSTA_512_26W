It is important to look at age (numeric) vs. IAT\n  - Why pixelate your data?? We only do it if we need to (aka age as numeric is NOT linear with IAT score)\n  \n\n## 3.1: What is our target population?\n\n- This is an important thing to flag as you analyze your results and interpret them for an audience\n\n \n\n- We restricted our population to the US\n- Harvard says the test is only for individuals 18+ years old\n- Test takers need access to the internet and a computer (or phone?)\n  \n \n\n- Another thought\n  - Sometimes your target population defines your sample\n  - Other times your sample defines your target population\n- Here we have a convenience sample, with specific restrictions and accessibility\n  - That means the population that we can generalize to is limited to those restrictions and accessibility!!\n- **We need to discuss these limitations when we present these results to the world!**\n\n\n## 3.2 Restrict your analysis to 1 outcome and 9 possible covariates/predictors\n\n::: columns\n::: column\nNeeded to pick the variable from your research question + 2 others (or 3 if you chose a different variable in your research question)\n\n1.
