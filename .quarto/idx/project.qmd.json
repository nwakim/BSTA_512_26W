The poster will be presented at the end of the quarter during our \"Poster day\".\n\n**I have designed 4 labs to scaffold our work and prevent a build-up of work at the end of the quarter.** I will guide you through specific analyses, plots, and interpretations that can be used in your final poster. However, not every component of the labs will be directly linked to the poster. That means certain figures may not be important for the poster or you may need to update components of the lab for presentation.\n\nNote that each lab has instructions on this site and a downloadable version. The downloadable version is a cleaner copy of the instructions where you will complete the work. This helps the TAs and I grade labs without sifting through my lengthy instructions (hehe).\n\nThe most important learning objectives in this project are:\n\n1.  **Understand and communicate your research question**, including its importance and context.\n2.  **Understand and communicate your analysis process** to an audience with some statistical background.\n3.  **Fit a linear model using R**\n4.  **Visualize your findings** so that others can understand your data and results.\n5.  **Interpret the results of a linear model** in the context of your research question. This involves:\n    a.  interpretations of specific relationships through coefficient estimates and\n    b.  interpretations of general trends\n6.  **Interpret interactions of a linear model**. I write this one separately because it is a more complicated process that is important.\n7.  **Contextualize your results** and articulate who or what your results represent.\n\n## Final Poster\n\n[Poster Instructions](/labs/Project_poster_instructions.qmd)\n\nPoster due 3/17\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ng=3\n```\n\n### Reading and listening sources\n\nIf you are interested in sources that discuss the social complexities of anti-fat bias, feel free to take a look at the following sources. **Please be aware that these resources will discuss anti-fat bias and related histories, including racism and sexism.**\n\n-   Article: [Implicit and explicit anti-fat bias: The role of weight-related attitudes and beliefs](./resources/Implicit_anti_fat.pdf)\n\n-   Podcast: [Anti-Fat Bias by Maintenance Phase](https://maintenancephase.buzzsprout.com/1411126/6524683-anti-fat-bias)\n\n-   Book: Fearing the Black Body: The Racial Origins of Fat Phobia\n\n    -   Multnomah County Library has unlimited loans for the audiobook\n\n-   Blog: [Dances with Fat](https://danceswithfat.org/)\n\n    -   You can subscribe to Ragen's weekly newsletter for free\n\nIf you have additional sources that you would like to share, please send them to me!\n\n## Lab rubric\n\n2 points will be deducted from labs that are late (without an approved extension).\n\n|   | 4 points | 3 points | 2 points | 1 point | 0 points |\n|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Formatting | Lab submitted on Sakai with `.html` file.
