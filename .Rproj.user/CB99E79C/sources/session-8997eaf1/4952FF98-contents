## Introduction to the project

**This project is designed to combine important learning objectives for the class into a deliverable final piece of work.** The project will be a poster that summarizes your research question, data, and findings. The poster will be presented at the end of the quarter during our "Poster day".

**I have designed 4 labs to scaffold our work and prevent a build-up of work at the end of the quarter.** I will guide you through specific analyses, plots, and interpretations that can be used in your final poster. However, not every component of the labs will be directly linked to the poster. That means certain figures may not be important for the poster or you may need to update components of the lab for presentation.

Note that each lab has instructions on this site and a downloadable version. The downloadable version is a cleaner copy of the instructions where you will complete the work. This helps the TAs and I grade labs without sifting through my lengthy instructions (hehe).

The most important learning objectives in this project are:

1.  **Understand and communicate your research question**, including its importance and context.
2.  **Understand and communicate your analysis process** to an audience with some statistical background.
3.  **Fit a linear model using R**
4.  **Visualize your findings** so that others can understand your data and results.
5.  **Interpret the results of a linear model** in the context of your research question. This involves:
    a.  interpretations of specific relationships through coefficient estimates and
    b.  interpretations of general trends
6.  **Interpret interactions of a linear model**. I write this one separately because it is a more complicated process that is important.
7.  **Contextualize your results** and articulate who or what your results represent.
